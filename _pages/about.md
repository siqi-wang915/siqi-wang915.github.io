<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Siqi Wang, and welcome to my personal website. I am currently a Ph. D. candidate. My major is Aerospace Science and Technology, with a focus on impact dynamics in the aerospace field and mechanical metamaterials. I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Mechanics from Hunan University (2018–2022) and have since graduated with a Master's degree from the School of Aerospace Engineering at Xiamen University (2022–2025), under the supervision of Professor Baoqiang Zhang at the Centre for Advanced Machine Design and Data Analytics (CAMDDA). I also served as a research assistant at the Aero Engine Academy of China (2023–2024).

I am majoring in solid mechanics and have rich experience in numerical simulation and vibration testing. I am devoted to using mechanical metamaterials in aerospace structures to improve their impact resistance. I will pursue research at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and solid mechanics in the future.

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose a fatigue life prediction method for Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) fan blades under aleatory and epistemic uncertainties with random damage, combining Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion–Monte Carlo Simulation (SPCE–MCS), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and Expectation-Maximization Gaussian Mixture Distribution (EM–GMD).

[Bird Strike Resistance Analysis for Engine Fan Blade Filled with Triply Periodic Minimal Surface](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

**Siqi Wang**, Chuangyu Jiang, Cunfu Wang, Baoqiang Zhang, Huageng Luo, Wujun Feng

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose using TPMS structures as lightweight fillers in wide-chord hollow fan blades to enhance bird strike resistance. A multi-level framework—spanning material, element, and component levels—demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its strong potential in aero-engine applications.

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We develop an improved Bayesian model updating method for stochastic dynamic models using frequency response functions (FRFs). By introducing a novel NHBFT-PCA-based validation metric, our approach enhances both traditional and approximate Bayesian methods. Numerical and experimental results show improved accuracy and efficiency over conventional techniques.

- We propose a vibration response prediction model for turbine engine blades by integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) with Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression (PIGPR). The model embeds frequency-domain physical properties into PINN and uses it as the mean function in Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), enabling both data-driven prediction and uncertainty analysis.
