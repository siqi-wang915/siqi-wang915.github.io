Welcome to my academic homepage. My name is Siqi Wang, and I am a self-motivated researcher currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the College of Intelligent Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing (CIRAM), Fudan University (2025–present), under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3CBuGosAAAAJ" target="_blank">Prof. Timon Rabczuk</a>. My research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to solid mechanics. I obtained my B.Eng. in Engineering Mechanics from Hunan University (2018–2022) and my M.Eng. in Aerospace Science and Technology from Xiamen University (2022–2025), where my work centered on impact dynamics and mechanical metamaterials for aerospace applications, supervised by <a href="https://aerospace.xmu.edu.cn/info/2463/48873.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Baoqiang Zhang</a> and <a href="https://aerospace.xmu.edu.cn/info/1623/41443.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Huageng Luo</a> at the Centre for Advanced Machine Design and Data Analytics (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/CAMDDA-Huageng-Luo" target="_blank">CAMDDA</a>). In addition, I served as an Assistant Researcher at at the Aero Engine Academy of China (2023–2024).

I specialize in solid mechanics and have extensive experience in numerical simulation and vibration testing. My current research focuses on the intersection of AI and solid mechanics.

[High-Cycle Fatigue Life Prediction for Fan Blades Considering Aleatory and Epistemic Uncertainty with Random Damage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202500393X)

Xiaodong Zhang, Dengyu Wu, Zhenhong Deng, **Siqi Wang**, Wujun Feng, Huageng Luo, Baoqiang Zhang

- We propose a fatigue life prediction method for Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) fan blades under aleatory and epistemic uncertainties with random damage, combining Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion–Monte Carlo Simulation (SPCE–MCS), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and Expectation-Maximization Gaussian Mixture Distribution (EM–GMD).

[Bird Strike Resistance Analysis for Engine Fan Blade Filled with Triply Periodic Minimal Surface](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1270963825001804)

**Siqi Wang**, Chuangyu Jiang, Cunfu Wang, Baoqiang Zhang, Huageng Luo, Wujun Feng

- We propose using TPMS structures as lightweight fillers in wide-chord hollow fan blades to enhance bird strike resistance. A multi-level framework—spanning material, element, and component levels—demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its strong potential in aero-engine applications.

[Improved Bayesian Model Updating Method for Frequency Response Function with Metrics Utilizing NHBFT-PCA](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/13/2076)

Jinhui Li, Zhenhong Deng, Yong Tang, **Siqi Wang**, Zhe Yang,  Huageng Luo, Wujun Feng, Baoqiang Zhang

- We develop an improved Bayesian model updating method for stochastic dynamic models using frequency response functions (FRFs). By introducing a novel NHBFT-PCA-based validation metric, our approach enhances both traditional and approximate Bayesian methods. Numerical and experimental results show improved accuracy and efficiency over conventional techniques.

[An Improved Finite Element Modeling Method for Triply Periodic Minimal Surface Structures Based on Element Size and Minimum Jacobian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04028)

**Siqi Wang**, Chuangyu Jiang, Xiaodong Zhang, Yilong Zhang, Baoqiang Zhang, Huageng Luo

[Prediction of Blade Vibration Response with Uncertainty Propagation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression]

Xiaodong Zhang, Daobo Sun, Dengyu Wu, **Siqi Wang**, Ting Liu, Huageng Luo, Baoqiang Zhang

- We propose a vibration response prediction model for turbine engine blades by integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) with Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression (PIGPR). The model embeds frequency-domain physical properties into PINN and uses it as the mean function in Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), enabling both data-driven prediction and uncertainty analysis.
